### Hi there 👋

I have spent over a decade learning and researching numerical methods for simulating and calibrating comptuational models in biology. Writing codes for scientific computing is my passion. This site displays some of my computational projects. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on visa paperwork to join my dream company accelerating Quantitative System Pharmacology and Virtual Populations!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software design principles. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fast numerical algorithms in Julia, especially those related to Bayesian computation, mathematical biology.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Starbucks name is Henry. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His.
