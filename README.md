### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have spent about a decade learning and researching numerical methods for simulating and calibrating comptuational models in biology. Writing codes for scientific computing is my passion. This site displays some of my computational projects. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on visa paperwork to join my dream company accelerating Quantitative System Pharmacology and Virtual Populations!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: software design principles, scientific machine learning with Julia, cool maths, Github Actions. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on efficient implementations of numerical algorithms in Julia, especially those related to Bayesian computation, machine learning, and mathematical biology.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My Starbucks name is Henry. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His.
